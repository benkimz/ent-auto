# Welcome to my ent-auto Repo

This project is works on automating updates about newly arrived TV shows and music that have started to gain popularity. This will keep you posted and perhaps help you in putting together your new playlist of shows and music as they gain momentum. For this project, data can be obtained from many sources but, I will consider <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> for now. Reddit, in the time of writing, provides free APIs from where we can get enough information about shows or music as we might need in the project. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/">Read about Reddit API here.</a> Please obey the <a href="https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API">reddit API rules</a>.

# Requirements
You can use different languages to implement this idea. However, I will consider <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> as the first option due to easier implementation. It is also possible to use <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a> or <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NODE JS</a> if you are comfortable with them.
